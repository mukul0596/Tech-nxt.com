Plasma Reactor in plasma chemistry and metallurgy, a unit of an assembly in
which heat- and mass-transfer processes are carried out with the 
participation of a low-temperature plasma. The term “plasma reactor” is 
sometimes applied not only to an individual unit but to a plasma assembly as
a whole. The basic requirements of plasma reactors are (1) attainment of an 
adequate mixing of the reagents, (2) provision of an adequate extent of the
zone of interaction, and (3) provision of conditions for efficient heat 
transfer and mass transfer with minimum heat losses.

When high-frequency induction plasmatrons are used to generate the plasma, 
the reaction zone can be combined with the discharge volume; such a reactor 
is called an open-type reactor. Jet plasma reactors, in which the plasma is 
produced as a shaped jet, exist in two types—direct-flow and counter-jet 
(Figure 1). An increased time of contact between reacting materials and 
intensified heat transfer and mass transfer—by comparison with simple 
direct-flow plasma reactors—are achieved in plasma reactors operating in the
counter-jet mode, in open-type plasma reactors, and in cyclone-type plasma 
reactors; such improved results can also be attained by the imposition of a 
constant electric or magnetic field, or both, on the high-frequency volume 
discharge.

Multiple-arc plasma reactors are promising with respect to the achievement 
of a uniform temperature field of the plasma flow, increase of the flow’s
power, improvement of mixing of reagents, and intensification of heat 
transfer and mass transfer.

The rapid development of technologies close to artificial intelligence, 
observed right now, will lead to the fact that AI will surpass the man in 
almost all spheres of activity already by 2060 – believe the staff of the 
Institute of the Future of Humanity, existing at Oxford University. British
scientists are in agreement with their American colleagues – researchers 
from Yale University. AI already now can get ahead of the person in many 
problems. For example, AlphaGo several times beat the best human players in 
go. Other systems better read on the lips of people or help detectives 
understand the police information. But each of the modern intellectual 
systems is good only in one thing and is useless in all other directions, 
unless it is taught to them. As the same researchers say, AI with a humanoid 
versatility will not appear soon.

The formation of AI as a competitor for the human mind will occur in several stages. For
starters, for example, artificial intelligence will learn to translate from one language to another.
He still does a good job of this task, but by 2024, according to forecasts, people-translators will
be left without work.
</p>
<p class=content>
By 2026 AI will be able to write essays no worse than high school graduates. By 2027 – will
learn to drive multi-ton trucks on public roads. Vendors will be unemployed by 2031, novelists –
by 2049, and artificial intelligence will replace surgeons by 2053. In a hundred – twenty years,
as scientists assume, there will be no problem at all with which a man would cope better than
AI.

Graphene is basically a substance which is 300 times stronger than steel and
made of only a thin layer of pure carbon, making it literally as light as a 
feather. Each sheet of graphene is only one atom thick, and one square meter 
weighs just 0.77 milligrams. In 2010 the Nobel Prize for Physics went to 
scientists researching this super film, and in 2013 a 1 billion dollar grant 
was awarded by the EU to researchers in the field.

The uses of this technology could be revolutionary: Space exploration and

Atmospheric Electricity Generation: Is this “true energy” the sleeping 
giant of renewables?

<p class=content>
A company called SEFE says that it will soon be able to generate a 
limitless supply of renewable energy by converting static electricity from 
the atmosphere into direct current.
</p>
<p class=content>
Ever since Benjamin Franklin and his kite, we have been aware of the 
electrical power that is statically and consistently present in great 
magnitude between the negatively charged earth and the positively charged 
atmosphere.
</p>
<p class=content>
Over the years (famously beginning with Nikola Tesla) there have been many attempts at
harnessing this latent energy for practical use.
<br>
But no one has been able to harness it in a practical way...until now 
perhaps? From the (nicely designed and informative) SEFE website:

<p class=content>
SEFE has developed a proprietary technology which aims to harvest the 
constant and powerful static electricity that is continually formed in the 
earth’s atmosphere. Through a series of patented and patent-pending devices,
SEFE’s Harmony system is designed to draw the static electricity in direct 
current form from the atmosphere, converting it to alternating current for
immediate power consumption. And, the system can reconvert the alternating 
current back into direct current form for longer-term storage in banks of 
batteries. The system’s design employs an airborne carrier, which can be a 
high-altitude weather balloon or blimp, to send a conductive cable into the 
atmosphere, where it is suspended and tethered in constant contact with a 
ground unit. Attached to the conductive cable is a “black box” which 
converts the naturally occurring electricity into usable form. The 
electricity is sent down the conductive cable to a power generator, which, 
in turn, can send the power to an existing electric company’s infrastructure
and grid for commercial and residential consumption. This platform generator 
also can convert the electricity for longer-term storage.
</p>
<p class=content>
SEFE's flagship product is called the Harmony III and it incorporates an 
electrostatic motor that operates as a generator when it is supplied with a 
high voltage/low current power source, such
 as that which is in abundant 
existence in the atmosphere. So far SEFE has received four patents for its 
system and has more pending approval.

Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
have now managed a significant breakthrough by ‘teleporting,’ or 
transferring, quantum information from one photon to another over a 
distance of 63 miles of optical fiber. This is 4x farther than the previous 
record. The research is published in the journal Optic. 
</p>
<p class=content>
The experiment confirmed that quantum communication is feasible over long 
distances in  fiber, while other institutes and researchers have teleported 
quantum  information over longer distances in free space. Fiber-optic lines 
offer much more flexibility for network design solutions.

The development of quantum theory began in 1900, when Max Planck presented 
an idea to the German Physical Society, introducing the notion that energy, 
as does matter, exists in individual units (which he called “quanta”).

Quantum computing is an area of study focused on developing computer 
technology based on the principles of quantum, which explains the nature 
and behaviour of energy and matter on the quantum (atomic and subatomic) 
level. 
</p>
<p class=content>
Essential elements of quantum theory include:
<br>
<br>
Energy, like matter, consists of discrete units rather than solely as a 
continuous wave. Elementary particles of both energy and matter, depending 
on the conditions, may behave like either particles or waves.
</p>
<p class=content>
The movement of elementary particles is inherently random and thus, 
unpredictable.
The simultaneous measurement of two complementary values, such 
as the position andmomentum of an elementary particle, is inescapably 
flawed; the more precisely one value is measured, the more flawed will be 
the measurement of the other value. Quantum correlations are non-local. 
When two quantum particles interact in the right way, their states will 
depend on one another no matter how far apart they are. A quantum particle 
moving from A to B will take every possible path from A to B at the same 
time.

Antimatter is the Bizarro twin of matter, made up of antiparticles that have 
the same mass as ordinary matter but with opposite atomic properties known 
as spin and charge. When the opposed particles meet, they annihilate each 
other and release tremendous amounts of energy as dictated by Einstein’s 
famous equation, E=mc<sup>2</sup>.

Antimatter is already in use in a medical imaging technique known as 
positron emission tomography (PET), but its use as a potential fuel source 
remains in the realm of science fiction.

The problem with antimatter is that there is very little of it in the 
universe. It can be produced in laboratories, but currently only in very 
tiny amounts, and at prohibitively high costs. And even if the problem of 
production could be solved, there is still the knotty question of how to 
store something that has a tendency to annihilate itself on contact with 
ordinary matter, and also how to harness that energy once created.

NASA funds research into creating antimatter drives that could one day take 
humanity to the stars, but dreams of antimatter-powered starships as seen on 
Star Trek are still a long way off, all experts agree.
