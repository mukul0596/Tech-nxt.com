Not to be confused with Google Goggles.
Google Glass is an optical head-mounted display designed in the shape of a 
pair of eyeglasses. It was developed by X (previously Google X) with the 
mission of producing a ubiquitous computer. Google Glass displayed 
information in a smartphone-like hands-free format. Wearers communicated 
with the Internet via natural language voice commands. Google 
started selling a prototype of Google Glass to qualified "Glass Explorers" 
in the US on April 15, 2013, for a limited period for $1,500, before it 
became available to the public on May 15, 2014. It also had a camera 
attached to it.

Touchpad: A touchpad is located on the side of Google Glass, allowing users 
to control the device by swiping through a timeline-like interface displayed 
on the screen. Sliding
backward shows current events, such as weather, 
and sliding forward shows past events, such as phone calls, photos, circle 
updates, etc.

Camera: Google Glass has the ability to take photos and record 720p HD 
video. 
<br>
Display: The Explorer version of Google Glass uses a liquid crystal on 
silicon (LCoS)(based on an LCoS chip from Himax), field-sequential color 
system, LED illuminated display. The display's LED illumination is 
first P-polarized and then shines through the in-coupling polarizing beam 
splitter (PBS) to the LCoS panel. The panel reflects the light and alters 
it to S-polarization at active pixel sensor sites. The in-coupling PBS then 
reflects the S-polarized areas of light at 45° through the out-coupling beam 
splitter to a collimating reflector at the other end. Finally, the 
out-coupling beam splitter (which is a partially reflecting mirror, not a 
polarizing beam splitter) reflects the collimated light another 45° and 
into the wearer's eye.

The Leap Motion controller is a small USB peripheral device which is 
designed to be placed on a physical desktop, facing upward. It can also be 
mounted onto a virtual reality headset. Using two monochromatic IR cameras 
and three infrared LEDs, the device observes a roughly hemispherical area, 
to a distance of about 1 meter. The LEDs generate pattern-less IR light 
and the cameras generate almost 200 frames per second of reflected data. 
This is then sent through a USB cable to the host computer, where it is 
analyzed by the Leap Motion software using "complex maths" in a way that has 
not been disclosed by the company, in some way synthesizing 3D position data 
by comparing the 2D frames generated by the two cameras. In a 2013 
study, the overall average accuracy of the controller was shown to be 0.7 
millimeters.

The smaller observation area and higher resolution of the device 
differentiates the product from the Kinect, which is more suitable for 
whole-body tracking in a space the size of a living room. In a 
demonstration to CNET, the controller was shown to perform tasks such as 
navigating a website, using pinch-to-zoom gestures on maps, high-precision 
drawing, and manipulating complex 3D data visualizations.
</p>
<p class=content>
Leap Motion initially distributed thousands of units to developers who are 
interested in creating applications for the device. The Leap Motion 
controller was first shipped in July 2013. In February 2016, Leap Motion 
released a major beta update to its core software. Dubbed Orion, the 
software is designed for hand tracking in virtual reality.

Cave2 is a hybrid reality environment that lets artists, scientists and 
engineers become fully immersed in their research. The Cave2 is a 360° 
wraparound structure consisting of 72 LCD panels, a 20-speaker surround 
sound system and a 10-camera optical motion tracking system.

With 3D glasses, scientists and engineers will actually be able to 
virtually experience and move through anything of their choosing, whether 
it’s the human body or planets in the solar system. The Cave2 holds an 
immense amount of potential, especially for situations involving large 
amounts of data requiring visualization.

In fact, a recent project fed crime data from the city of Chicago into 
Cave2, allowing policymakers and investigators to virtually fly through 
Chicago, accompanied by real-time crime data and information.

iOS and Android are great, but they each have their own rules and policies 
that certainly inhibit the creative efforts of developers. Mozilla has since 
decided to build a new mobile operating system from scratch, one that will 
focus on true openness, freedom and user choice. It’s Firefox OS.
</p>
<p class=content>
Firefox OS is built on Gonk, Gecko and Gaia software layers – for the rest 
of us, it means it is built on open source, and it carries web technologies 
such as HTML5 and CSS3.

Developers can create and debut web apps without the blockade of 
requirements set by app stores, and users could even customize the OS based 
on their needs. Currently the OS has made its debut on Android-compatible 
phones, and the impression so far, is great.
</p>
<p class=content>
You can use the OS to do essential tasks you do on iOS or Android: calling friends,
 browsing web, taking photos, playing games, they are all possible on Firefox OS, 
set to rock the smartphone market

When's the last time you memorized a phone number? For many of us, we're already outsourcing parts of 
our brains to our devices. But imagine if the next gadget you bought wasn't a smartphone, but something 
to actually augment your body.
</p>
<p class=content>
That's the premise of the Third Thumb, a new controllable prosthetic created by British product design 
student Dani Clode. The thumb is a controllable extra digit, complete with two motors and flexible hinges, 
giving the 3D-printed device the dynamic motion and range of a real thumb.
</p>

<p class=content>
The concept of extending the breadth of our grasp through the addition of an extra, controllable finger 
or thumb is certainly novel. But what's truly notable about this new device is who it is for. While prosthetics 
are often thought of only as devices for people with disabilities, the intent with this design is to extend its 
wearer's natural abilities — and that could be anyone.
</p>
<p class=content>
What's unique about something like the Third Thumb is that it pushes us to consider what "optimal" 
human functioning really is, and with that, how we might become even more powerful through augmentation.
<br>
Of course, this brave new world doesn't come without concerns.
<br>
"I think the biggest concern is when the technology becomes stronger, faster, or more interesting than our 
biological bodies, and people start looking to actually replace parts of their bodies for better alternatives,
"cautions Clode. "There are a lot of ethical issues surrounding this, but it is their body and their choice."
</p>
<p class=content>
With elective prosthetics, the digital divide that has traditionally separated those who can afford new 
technologies and those who can't, extends to how people are able to augment their brains or bodies. For 
instance, imagine what happens when wealthier kids can get legs that make them faster on the 
schoolyard, or a brain chip that helps them memorize algebra equations.
</p>
<img src="Data/third_thumb6.jpg" width=40% height=300 border=5 
class=inn_img>
<p class=content>
The Third Thumb website calls the project a "starting base for a lot of future adaption of aesthetic," but 
mentions no plans to market the device.
